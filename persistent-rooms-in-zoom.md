# How to make a 'permanent' Zoom rooms

Zoom.us is a great teleconferencing app for teams. Our team @Siyelo has found it to have far superior call quality to Google Hangouts, and less intrusive than Sqwiggle. Several of our clients use Zoom as well!

However, Zoom takes a similar approach to Google Hangouts in which 'rooms' are created on-demand. What we wanted is a way of creating a permanent 'hangout' that the whole team could access, at the same url, whenever they wanted. Think [Sqwiggle]() but with several rooms, and optional video/voice participation.

Fortunately we can create 'permanent' rooms in Zoom through their recurring meeting feature.

## Benefits

With this approach, we are able to use Zoom in the way that works for us.

- Permanent team Hangout
- Project-specific Hangouts
- High quality
- Ad-Hoc 'Private' Meetings (well, mostly.)

You don't get fully private ad-hoc rooms unless you are a Host and create a new meeting. But thats okay for us, as we generally like keep our conversations open to everyone. For those truly private conversations, we jump across to an unused room, or a different medium better suited to 1-on-1s (e.g. Skype)

This is similar to how Sqwiggle works - but you can have multiple rooms for different topics. For example we have one 'team' room for everyone at @Siyelo, and different dedicated rooms for each client project (which we share with each client). This more or less correlates to the number of [Flowdock](https://www.flowdock.com/) chatrooms we have.

## The Setup

If you set up a recurring meeting (and as the 'Host' you never 'leave' the chat), you can create dedicated chat rooms that your team can use whenever they want to jump in. So not only do you only need one paid 'Host' account, the chat rooms persist, so you can bookmark them.

People can just jump in/out as needed, or just sit passively in the room and listen (with their own sound/video turned off, if they so choose). It also means that only one team member needs have an account to set up the recurring meeting(s). Otherwise, to set up ad-hoc meetings, each person in the team would need to have a paid account.

## Conclusion

We found using Zoom this way to be a lot less intrusive than Sqwiggle, which defaults to having your camera on either all the time, or taking regular photos of you.

With this setup, we are able to have high-quality teleconf chats, a permanent team 'hangout' room, and often ad-hoc meetings.
